# Movie Mela

## Project Description

Movie Mela is a movie watchlist application developed using Vite, React, and TypeScript. This application allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and manage their personal watchlists. Users can create accounts, log in, and log out using their email addresses. The movie data is fetched from the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API, and user data is stored locally to maintain personalized watchlists across sessions.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Simple email-based authentication without the need for email verification.
-   **Movie Search**: Search movies by title using the OMDb API.
-   **Movie Details**: View detailed information about movies including title, release year, poster, and plot summary.
-   **Watchlist Management**: Add and remove movies from personal watchlists.
-   **Persistent Data**: Store user data locally to ensure personalized watchlists are maintained.

## Technologies Used

-   **Vite**: For fast and optimized development.
-   **React**: For building the user interface.
-   **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code management.
-   **OMDb API**: To fetch movie data.
